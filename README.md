 tried to recreate this game in UE5 by following a UE4 tutorial on YouTube. I learned a lot about UI, animation, and programming.
When you touch the circles, some decrease your health while others increase it.
When you reach the center, it emits light, and when you move away, the light disappears.
I had started working on an automatic lighting system, but I couldn't complete it.
When you go to the squares, a UI appears with messages like "Press E to pick up."
